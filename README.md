# Collatz Conjecture Iterative Calculator in Python
Python version of collatz conjecture C++ program I wrote earlier.  
Environment was set up using Anaconda.  
Numpy arrays used instead of lists, numpy also needs to be installed.  
For the graphs part of the program, matplotlib needs to be installed.  
Made in Python v3.10.4  
Please be warned this has not been tested on numbers higher than in the hundreds
and the number of hailstone numbers in such cases may be very high, leading to 
memory problems.  
There were some errors and bugs in the C++ version which have been fixed here,
which were found due to the visual representation and noticing the differences in 
the data and the graphs.  
Just goes to show you the importance of debugging I guess.
