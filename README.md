# Collatz Conjecture Iterative Calculator in Python
Python version of collatz conjecture C++ program I wrote earlier.  
Environment was set up using Anaconda.  
Numpy arrays used instead of lists, numpy also needs to be installed.  
For the graph part of the program, matplotlib needs to be installed.  
Made in Python v3.10.4  
Please be warned this has not been tested on numbers higher than in the hundreds
and the number of hailstone numbers in such cases may be very high, leading to 
memory problems.
